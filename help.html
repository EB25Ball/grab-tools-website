        <p>As explained <a href="https://github.com/Slin/GRAB-Level-Format">here</a>, 
            levels in GRAB are stored in .level files. 
            The files themselves are stored in your headset in 
            <code>Android/data/com.slindev.grab_demo/levels/user</code>
             or <code>Android/data/com.slindev.grablevels/user/levels/user</code> for the tester version,
              and are named by the <a href="https://unixtime.org/">Unix timestamp</a> of when they were created (Seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970). 
            These files are most simply the info about the level and a list of <code>levelNodes</code> (objects), and it is by editing these files that most of these tools work.
             The files themselves are in <a href="https://protobuf.dev/">Google Protobuf</a> format meaning they can't be modified directly, but by converting them to readable JSON format we are able to do so easily.

        <div class="title"><a href="#transferringFiles">#</a> Transferring Files</div>
        <p>
            To transfer files to or from your headset to your computer, you will need to use a file transfer app such as <a href="https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto">Sidequest</a> (Advanced installer).
            Once you have Sidequest installed, plug in your headset to your computer and open the files tab (Folder icon). From there, navigate to your <code>levels/user</code> folder in the grab files and either upload or download .level files.

            <h3><a href="edit.html">Level JSON Editor</a> - Edit .level files in JSON format</h3>
            <p>
                This tool allows you to edit .level files in JSON format, which is much easier to read and edit than the Protobuf format.
                To upload a file click <code>Click me and select a file!</code> and locate a .level file. A textbox will appear with the JSON contents of the file.
                You can then save the file with <code>Download</code> and it will be converted back to Protobuf format (.level) and saved to your PC.
                You also have the option to copy the JSON directly with <code>Copy JSON</code>, but this will not work in game until reconverted back to protobuf (.level).
            </p>
            <h3><a href="compiler.html">Level Compiler</a> - Compile .level files into one</h3>
            <p>
                This tool allows you to compile multiple .level files into one larger file and groups each individual level for ease of use.
                To upload files click <code>Click me and select multiple files!</code> and locate multiple .level files you would like to compile.
                You can then save the file with <code>Compile</code> and it will be saved to your PC.
                You also have the option to copy the JSON directly with <code>Copy JSON</code>, but this will not work in game until reconverted back to protobuf (.level).
            </p>
            <h3><a href="pixels.html">Pixel Art</a> - Create pixel art in grab</h3>
            <p>
                This tool allows you to create pixel art in grab. You can choose the quality of the image and the basic level details.
                To create pixel art, click <code>Click me and select an image!</code> and locate an image file (preferrably a png).
                You can then save the file with <code>Pixelate</code> and it will be saved to your PC.
                You also have the option to copy the JSON directly with <code>Copy JSON</code>, but this will not work in game until reconverted back to protobuf (.level).
